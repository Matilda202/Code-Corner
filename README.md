# Pig Dice Game
A simple terminal-based implementation of the classic Pig Dice game, written in Python. This version supports 1 to 4 players, with  bots filling in if needed. Includes a fun "Double or Nothing" gamble mechanic!

## How to Play
- Each player takes turns rolling a six-sided die.
- If a player rolls a 1, their turn ends and they earn 0 points for the turn.
- If they roll 2-6, the value is added to their turn score, and they can choose to roll again or hold.
- After holding, players can gamble their turn score with a "Double or Nothing" chance.
- First player to 50 points wins.
- If playing solo, the game adds a bot automatically. Bots decide when to hold and whether to gamble based on simple heuristics.
